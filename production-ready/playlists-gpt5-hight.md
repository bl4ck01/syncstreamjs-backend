[BEAST MODE ACTIVATED]

I reviewed the playlists route, client component, server actions, store, xtream client, middleware, and config for production readiness and Next.js 15.5 alignment; below are the issues and recommended improvements.

### High-priority issues

- Security: plaintext IPTV credentials persisted client-side
  - Evidence:
```74:83:frontend/src/store/playlist.js
playlists[playlistId] = {
  id: playlistId,
  meta: {
    name: playlistConfig.name || '',
    baseUrl: playlistConfig.baseUrl,
    username: playlistConfig.username,
    password: playlistConfig.password, // Note: encrypt in production
    lastUpdatedAt: Date.now(),
  },
  data,
};
```
  - Impact: Passwords stored in browser storage (localforage), at rest and accessible to XSS; violates your repo rule 5.1.1 (encryption at rest) and general security best practices.
  - Improvement: Never store credentials on the client. Proxy all Xtream requests via backend APIs; keep credentials encrypted in DB server-side; the frontend should only fetch derived content via authenticated backend endpoints.

- CORS, data fetching and exposure of credentials from the browser
  - Evidence:
```12:19:frontend/src/lib/xtream.js
const resp = await fetch(url, { 
  cache: 'no-store',
  mode: 'cors',
  headers: { 'Accept': 'application/json', 'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; IPTV-Client/1.0)' }
});
```
  - Impact: Browser-originating calls to IPTV providers leak credentials to third parties, face CORS failures and rate limits, and are hard to secure/monitor.
  - Improvement: Move all Xtream requests to the backend; return signed, normalized datasets to the client. If needed, prefetch on the server (RSC) and stream to the client.

- Middleware not applied to `/playlists`
  - Evidence:
```80:88:frontend/src/middleware.js
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/auth/login',
    '/auth/register',
    '/pricing',
    '/',
    '/(app)/:path*',
    '/profiles',
  ],
};
```
  - Impact: `/(app)/:path*` does not match the public URL (group folders are invisible). `/playlists` is not matched unless explicitly listed, so auth/routing protections may not run on the playlists page.
  - Improvement: Replace the matcher with a proper pattern that covers all app routes except public/static (e.g., a negative lookahead) or explicitly add `/playlists`.

- Client bundle bloat risk on playlists page
  - Evidence: Heavy client-only component with rich animations and a large UI component (`PlaylistMagicBento`) plus numerous libraries (framer-motion, gsap, tsparticles, etc.). The file is large (617 lines).
  - Impact: Increased TTI/INP, reduced responsiveness on mobile, and higher memory.
  - Improvement: Split and lazy-load heavy visual components via `next/dynamic` with `suspense`, or render them conditionally; keep essential controls interactive; gate optional effects by `prefers-reduced-motion`.

- Credentials and sensitive flows in client UI
  - Evidence:
```97:120:frontend/src/components/playlist-dialog.js
if (playlist) {
  form.reset({
    name: playlist.name || '',
    url: playlist.url || '',
    username: playlist.username || '',
    password: playlist.password || '',
    is_active: playlist.is_active ?? true
});
```
  - Impact: Autofilling passwords increases exposure in the browser and risks accidental leaks.
  - Improvement: Do not prefill passwords; use placeholders and server-side credential updates via a dedicated flow.

### Medium-priority issues

- Redundant server action layers and duplication
  - Evidence: Two modules with similar responsibilities and duplicate `performRequest` logic.
```1:33:frontend/src/server/actions.js
'use server';
...
async function performRequest(...)
```
```1:12:frontend/src/server/playlist-actions.js
'use server';
...
async function performRequest(...)
```
  - Impact: Inconsistency, duplicated logic, higher maintenance risk.
  - Improvement: Consolidate to one server actions module or shared `performRequest` utility; keep a single source of truth for revalidation and headers.

- Cache invalidation strategy not using tags
  - Evidence: `revalidatePath('/playlists')` in create/update/delete; reads are ad-hoc via server actions.
```82:88:frontend/src/server/playlist-actions.js
if (data?.success) {
  revalidatePath('/playlists');
}
```
  - Impact: Path-based invalidation works but is coarse; no reuse across segments or widgets.
  - Improvement: Adopt fetch cache tags (`next: { tags: ['playlists'] }`) and `revalidateTag('playlists')`; this aligns with 15.5 best practices and scales better.

- Suspense wrapper offers little benefit here
  - Evidence:
```24:31:frontend/src/app/(app)/playlists/page.js
<Suspense fallback={<div className="min-h-screen bg-black" />}>
  <PlaylistsContent ... />
</Suspense>
```
  - Impact: Wrapping a client component that doesn’t suspend won’t stream anything meaningful; adds indirection.
  - Improvement: Either suspend a streaming server component inside the boundary or remove the boundary. Prefer `loading.js` for skeletons at the route level.

- Heavy logic in client state and hydration timing
  - Evidence: Zustand store, hydration flagging, localforage persistence, loading/fetch on mount.
```55:67:frontend/src/store/playlist.js
loadPlaylistData: async (playlistConfig) => {
  ...
  const data = await fetchXtreamAllData(playlistConfig);
```
  - Impact: More client work, hydration delays, variability across devices.
  - Improvement: Do the heavy lifting server-side (RSC or API), stream smaller data to client; use optimistic UI plus background refresh signals.

- Middleware doing network calls on every request
  - Evidence:
```15:26:frontend/src/middleware.js
const resp = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/auth/me`, { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${jwt}` }, cache: 'no-store' });
```
  - Impact: Latency and edge runtime cost; brittle behavior on outages.
  - Improvement: Minimize logic in middleware. If feasible, validate JWT locally (public key) or move checks into server actions/route handlers and rely on redirects.

- Inconsistent naming and invocation patterns for server actions
  - Evidence: Mixing `deletePlaylist` (from `actions.js`) and `setDefaultPlaylistAction` (from `playlist-actions.js`).
```14:17:frontend/src/components/playlists-content.js
import { deletePlaylist as deletePlaylistAction } from '@/server/actions';
import { setDefaultPlaylistAction } from '@/server/playlist-actions';
```
  - Impact: Confusing API; harder to onboard and test.
  - Improvement: Standardize names (`<verb>PlaylistAction`) and keep them all in one module.

### Low-priority issues

- Page-level loading and error boundaries missing
  - Impact: Route-level `loading.js` and `error.js` provide better UX than ad-hoc Suspense and client ErrorBoundary alone.
  - Improvement: Add `(app)/playlists/loading.js` and `(app)/playlists/error.js`; keep client ErrorBoundary for UI-only exceptions.

- `router.refresh()` plus `revalidatePath` redundancy
  - Evidence:
```171:177:frontend/src/components/playlists-content.js
if (result.success) {
  router.refresh();
  toast.success('Default playlist updated');
}
```
  - Impact: Slightly redundant; prefer cache tags plus refresh only when needed.
  - Improvement: Standardize on `revalidateTag` and refresh if you must; avoid double invalidation.

- Accessibility and reduced-motion
  - Impact: Motion-heavy components can harm accessibility.
  - Improvement: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`, provide keyboard focus styles, and aria labels for key actions.

- Observability and error reporting
  - Impact: Console logs won’t help in production.
  - Improvement: Add client and server error reporting (e.g., Sentry) and structured logs.

- ESLint and config hygiene
  - Evidence: `eslint.config.mjs` is present; `lint` script uses `eslint`.
  - Improvement: Ensure rules cover accessibility and React 19 patterns; add CI gate. Consider `@next/eslint-plugin-next` rules updating for 15.5.

### Next.js 15.5 alignment

- Data fetching and caching
  - Use RSC for read paths where possible; add `cache` options and `tags`. Mark dynamic pages as needed (`export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`) when requests are per-user and cannot be cached.
  - Move Xtream calls to server (RSC or API) to enable streaming and eliminate CORS/credential risks.

- Server Actions
  - Direct invocation from client is OK in 15.5 but prefer form actions (`<form action={action}>`) or `useActionState` for progressive enhancement and accessibility.
  - Consolidate actions and use tags for invalidation.

- Middleware
  - Keep extremely light; avoid remote calls when possible. Fix matcher so auth protection consistently applies.

- Routing UX
  - Prefer route-segment `loading.js` and `error.js`. Use `not-found.js` where applicable.

### Concrete improvement proposals

- Security and data flow
  - Remove client-side credential storage; handle credentials server-side only; proxy all Xtream requests through backend. Return sanitized, minimal datasets to the client.
  - Don’t prefill passwords in forms; provide a separate “update password” flow.

- Stability and performance
  - Dynamic import heavy visual components with `suspense`; respect reduced-motion; split code by feature. Audit `PlaylistMagicBento` for large deps and move non-essential visuals behind lazy boundaries.
  - Shift playlist data fetching to RSC or backend routes; the client store should primarily cache display-ready, non-sensitive data.

- Caching and invalidation
  - Use fetch tags (`next: { tags: ['playlists'] }`) and `revalidateTag('playlists')` in server actions. Keep `router.refresh()` minimal.
  - Where necessary, mark the route as dynamic to avoid unintended caching.

- Middleware and routing
  - Fix `matcher` to include `/playlists` (and other routes) or use a broad matcher with negative lookahead to exclude static assets.
  - Consider moving subscription/profile gating to server actions/route handlers with redirects to reduce middleware complexity.

- DX and standards
  - Unify server actions into one module; dedupe `performRequest`. Add small utilities for auth headers and timeouts.
  - Add route-level `loading.js` and `error.js`. Keep the client ErrorBoundary for local UI issues.

- Testing and monitoring
  - Add e2e tests (Playwright) for auth gating, create/update/delete playlists, and default playlist switching.
  - Add error reporting and basic RUM metrics on the playlists page.

### Selected code references

- Page setup and Suspense:
```10:31:frontend/src/app/(app)/playlists/page.js
export default async function PlaylistsPage() {
  const [playlistsResponse, profileResponse] = await Promise.all([
    getPlaylists(),
    getCurrentProfile()
  ]);
  ...
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div className="min-h-screen bg-black" />}>
      <PlaylistsContent ... />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

- Client imports server actions from two places:
```14:17:frontend/src/components/playlists-content.js
import { deletePlaylist as deletePlaylistAction } from '@/server/actions';
import { setDefaultPlaylistAction } from '@/server/playlist-actions';
```

- Middleware matcher not covering `/playlists`:
```80:88:frontend/src/middleware.js
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/auth/login',
    '/auth/register',
    '/pricing',
    '/',
    '/(app)/:path*',
    '/profiles',
  ],
};
```

- Xtream fetch from browser:
```12:19:frontend/src/lib/xtream.js
const resp = await fetch(url, { 
  cache: 'no-store',
  mode: 'cors',
  headers: { 'Accept': 'application/json', 'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; IPTV-Client/1.0)' }
});
```

- Password persisted in client store:
```74:81:frontend/src/store/playlist.js
meta: {
  baseUrl: playlistConfig.baseUrl,
  username: playlistConfig.username,
  password: playlistConfig.password, // Note: encrypt in production
  lastUpdatedAt: Date.now(),
},
```

- Dual performRequest implementations:
```8:22:frontend/src/server/actions.js
async function performRequest(path, options = {}) { ... }
```
```8:22:frontend/src/server/playlist-actions.js
async function performRequest(path, options = {}) { ... }
```

- Revalidation after mutations:
```82:86:frontend/src/server/playlist-actions.js
if (data?.success) {
  revalidatePath('/playlists');
}
```

- Dialog autofills password:
```101:107:frontend/src/components/playlist-dialog.js
form.reset({
  name: playlist.name || '',
  url: playlist.url || '',
  username: playlist.username || '',
  password: playlist.password || '',
  is_active: playlist.is_active ?? true
});
```

- Router refresh after default update:
```174:181:frontend/src/components/playlists-content.js
if (result.success) {
  router.refresh();
  toast.success('Default playlist updated');
}
```
