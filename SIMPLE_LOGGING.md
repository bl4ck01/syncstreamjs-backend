# Simple Console Logging Implementation

## Overview

As requested, I've simplified the logging system to use basic `console.log` statements instead of the complex logger service that was consuming performance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Complex Logger Service
- Deleted `/src/services/logger.js` entirely
- Removed all imports of the logger service
- Removed logger initialization from all routes

### 2. Replaced with Simple Console Logs

#### Auth Routes (`/src/routes/auth.js`)
```javascript
// Instead of complex logging with metadata extraction:
console.log(`[AUTH] Signup attempt for ${email}`);
console.log(`[AUTH] User registered successfully: ${user.email}`);
console.log(`[AUTH] Login attempt for ${email}`);
console.log(`[AUTH] Login successful for: ${user.email}`);
console.log(`[AUTH] Login failed - Invalid password for: ${email}`);
console.log(`[AUTH] User logged out: ${userId}`);
```

#### Profile Routes (`/src/routes/profiles.js`)
```javascript
console.log(`[PROFILE] PIN required but not provided for profile ${profileId}`);
console.log(`[PROFILE] Invalid PIN for profile ${profileId}`);
```

#### Webhook Routes (`/src/routes/webhooks.js`)
```javascript
console.log(`[WEBHOOK] Subscription update: ${subscription.id} for user: ${userId}`);
console.log(`[WEBHOOK] Trial started for user: ${userId}`);
console.log(`[WEBHOOK] Subscription created: ${subscription.id}`);
console.log(`[WEBHOOK] Subscription canceled: ${subscription.id}`);
console.log(`[WEBHOOK] Payment successful for subscription: ${invoice.subscription}, amount: ${amount} ${currency}`);
console.log(`[WEBHOOK] Payment failed for subscription: ${subscriptionId}`);
console.log(`[WEBHOOK] Checkout completed: ${session.id}`);
console.log(`[WEBHOOK] Credits purchased: ${creditAmount} credits for user ${userId}`);
```

#### Subscription Routes (`/src/routes/subscriptions.js`)
```javascript
console.log(`[SUBSCRIPTION] Checkout started for user ${userId}, plan: ${plan.name}`);
console.log(`[SUBSCRIPTION] Plan change requested from ${oldPlan} to ${newPlan}`);
console.log(`[SUBSCRIPTION] Subscription canceled: ${subscription.stripe_subscription_id}`);
console.log(`[SUBSCRIPTION] Subscription reactivated: ${subscription.stripe_subscription_id}`);
```

## Benefits

1. **No Performance Overhead**: Simple console.log is non-blocking and has minimal impact
2. **No Complex Metadata Extraction**: No more extracting IP addresses, user agents, etc.
3. **No Database Queries**: Removed all security event database storage
4. **Simple and Clear**: Each log is a simple one-liner showing what happened
5. **Easy to Grep**: Consistent prefixes ([AUTH], [WEBHOOK], etc.) make it easy to filter logs

## Rate Limiting Removed

Since we're not storing failed login attempts in the database, the rate limiting functionality has been removed. If you need rate limiting in the future, consider using:
- Redis for in-memory storage
- External rate limiting service
- Nginx rate limiting

## Admin Endpoints

- Security log endpoints now return empty results since we don't store security events
- Subscription events are still stored in the database and can be queried
- Analytics endpoints return empty data for security events

## Production Recommendations

For production use, you can:
1. Pipe console output to a log aggregation service (CloudWatch, Datadog, etc.)
2. Use PM2 or similar process managers that handle log rotation
3. Add log levels if needed (console.error for errors, console.warn for warnings)
4. Consider structured logging format if needed by your log aggregation service
