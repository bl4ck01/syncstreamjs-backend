## ‚ö†Ô∏è Production Deployment Requirements

### Environment Setup
1. Set strong JWT_SECRET (32+ characters)
2. Configure Stripe production keys
3. Set NODE_ENV=production
4. Configure proper CORS_ORIGIN
5. Set up SSL certificates
6. Configure database backups

### Database
1. Run migrations: `bun run src/db/migrate.js`
2. Set up read replicas for scaling
3. Configure automated backups
4. Monitor connection pool usage

### Infrastructure
1. Use reverse proxy (Nginx) for SSL termination
2. Set up load balancer for horizontal scaling
3. Configure CDN for static assets
4. Set up monitoring alerts

## üìã Pre-launch Checklist

- [ ] Update all environment variables for production
- [ ] Test all Stripe webhooks with production events
- [ ] Verify email service configuration
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure SSL certificates
- [ ] Test rate limiting under load
- [ ] Verify graceful shutdown works
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts
- [ ] Create admin user account
- [ ] Test all payment flows end-to-end

## üöÄ MVP Features Ready

1. **User Management**: Signup, login, profiles
2. **Subscription System**: Plans, trials, payments
3. **Content Management**: Playlists, favorites, progress
4. **Reseller Portal**: Credit system, client management
5. **Admin Dashboard**: User management, stats
